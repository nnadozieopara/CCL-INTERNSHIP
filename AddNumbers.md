#...Algorithm to add two number...#

0. Start
1. Declare variable firstNum of type double (This will accommodate data types of integer, float and double) to hold the first number
2. Declare variable secondNum of type double (This will accommodate data types of integer, float and double) to hold the second number
3. initialise firstNum; that is assign a value to it.(input from the user)
4. check if firstNum is of the required data type. If it is not, print invalid input.
5. initialise secondNum; that us to assign a value to it. (input from the user)
6. check if secondNum is of the required data type. If it is not, print invalid input.
7. declare variable sum of type double ; to hold the result of the sum of variables firstNum and secondSum;
8. assign the variable sum = firstSum + secondSum;
9. print the variable sum;
